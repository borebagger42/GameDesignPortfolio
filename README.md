# GameDesignPortfolio

Hello and welcome to my game design portfolio! Here are just a few examples of various works I have done in the field. It was hard to narrow it down but I tried to pick one thing to represent three different areas of knowledge ane experience, graphics engines, unity development, and AI engines for games. 

I primarily use repl.it rather than github so if you would like a more comprehensive look at various smaller projects I have done on that platform, here is the link to my profile https://replit.com/@jk1885 

Thank you for considering me for your program and I hope to see you in the future!
